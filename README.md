# VHDL-TestBench-Generator
VHDL Test Benches generator. Output still not for generic usage, intended for everyone who wants to write its own computational logic of an hardware component based on the current exisiting parallel code with random RAM instances generator. Will, may be, optimized for generic usage in the future.
